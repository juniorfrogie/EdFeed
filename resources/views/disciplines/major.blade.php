            No, Agriculture & Forestry doesn’t just mean you cut down trees all day long. And, even though you will be able to name every flower or plant that you see, that isn’t the only thing you’ll learn how to do. Agriculture & Forestry is, in fact, a vital scientific field that relates to plant and animal life, and the environments they thrive in. You’ll learn about forest restoration, managing natural resources, and preserving the natural beauty that surrounds us.
